## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**

- 🔮 **Predictive Traffic Modeling:** Train LSTM or Prophet models to anticipate traffic surges based on historical data.
- 🌆 **Smart City Integration:** Connect to civic APIs and emergency vehicle systems for coordinated flow.
- 📡 **IoT Sensor Fusion:** Merge data from LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and vehicle GPS with CCTV analytics.
- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Implement Q-learning or DQN to enable the system to optimize over time.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Based Admin Panel:** Deploy GUI to AWS/GCP for global monitoring and dashboard control.
- 🛣️ **Multi-Lane/Intersection Scaling:** Expand logic to handle 4-way/6-way and roundabout junctions.
- 🔐 **Secure + Compliant:** Use JWTs, OAuth2, and data masking to enforce role-based access and data privacy.
